                       <p>
                           My name is George Mwangi Gachara.Im aged 19 and recently finished my highschool education.
                           I am currently a Software development student at Moringa school.I really enjoy playing and watching rugby as well as watching american football and soccer.
                           Coding was not really what i pictured myself doing but it is a skill that im falling in love with and hope that i will be able to incorporate it in my daily endeavours.
